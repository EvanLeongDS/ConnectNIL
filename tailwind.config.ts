     * matchScore badge colours. Tailwind only emits utilities it literally sees in a
     * scanned file, so leaving lib/ out meant every class in those strings that was not
     * ALSO written out somewhere in app/ or components/ compiled to nothing.
     *
     * That is why the profile editors rendered as white pills on the dark card:
     * `bg-white` exists everywhere so it shipped, but `dark:bg-[#0f1623]`,
     * `dark:placeholder-white/25` and `dark:[color-scheme:dark]` appear nowhere else in
     * the codebase and were never generated — so there was no dark rule to override the
     * light one. The deal forms only escaped because DealRespondButtons.tsx happens to
     * duplicate the same string inline.
